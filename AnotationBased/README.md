#### Anotation based configuration
* we have two type of container 1) Application context and 2) Bean Factory
* We have container whose contains all beans object
* we have three type of meta data configuration 1) XML based configuration 2) Anotation Based configuration 3) Java Based configuration

##### Anotation configuration
No redundancy, time saving , performation low, readability high , each time need to scan the package and subpackage,decrease performance


##### XML Based || Java Based configuration
bean defination, scope defination, dependency injection mechanisiom, every thing mentioned into the one  file and it is good for performance perspective, readabilitiy good but disadvantage is too much redundant and each time need to modify confuguration file while creating pojo

* two type of injection
1) setter injection 2) constructor based injection
